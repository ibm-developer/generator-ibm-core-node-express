This generator produces a simple Express-based Node.js server project, with all the ingredients you need for a good start at building a cloud native application. It can be run locally or remotely (e.g. IBM Cloud).

## Pre-requisites

Install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io)

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g generator-ibm-core-node-express
```

## Usage

```bash
yo ibm-core-node-express --bluemix='{"name":"<project-name>"}'
```

Following command line arguments are supported:
 
*  `--bluemix='{"name":"<project-name>","backendPlatform":"NODE"}'`. 
*  You will need at least a project name to run it locally.
*  You can alternatively supply a local file containing compatible JSON object by using `--bluemix file:path/to/file.json`

## Artifacts

Here is a list of the files and folders you receive after executing the generator:  

File  | Purpose
---       | ---
README.md | Instructions for building, running, and deploying the project
package.json | JSON file containing project info, scripts, nodemonConfig, and dependencies
public/* | Folder containing files for server landing page (specifically public/index.html)
server/* | Folder containing server configuration files (specifically server/server.js)
test/* | Folder containing JSON files for running code tests (npm test)

## Development

Clone this repository and link it via npm

```
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer/generator-ibm-core-node-express
cd generator-ibm-core-node-express
npm link
```

In a separate directory invoke the generator via

```
yo ibm-core-node-express --bluemix='{"name":"<project-name>"}'  
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests

```
npm test
```

## Publishing Changes

In order to publish changes, you will need to fork the repository or branch off the `master` branch.

Make sure to follow the [conventional commit specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/) before contributing. To help you with commit a commit template is provide. Run `config.sh` to initialize the commit template to your `.git/config` or use [commitizen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commitizen)

Once you are finished with your changes, run `npm test` to make sure all tests pass.

Do a pull request against `master`, make sure the build passes. A team member will review and merge your pull request.
Once merged to `master` an auto generated pull request will be created against master to update the changelog. Make sure that the CHANGELOG.md and the package.json is correct before merging the pull request. After the auto generated pull request has been merged to `master` the version will be bumped and published to Artifactory.
